 # Complete Process of Building CarCadabra
   <ol>
                <li><b>Data Collection:</b> Gather data on car sales, including features such as car's cost price, previous owners, year of buying, kilometers driven, Fuel type, Seller type, Transmission along with the actual selling prices.</li>
                <li><b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Clean the data, handle missing values, and preprocess features (e.g., encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features).</li>
                <li><b>Feature Selection:</b> Identify the most relevant features that influence car prices.</li>
                <li><b>Model Training:</b> Chose regression algorithm and train the model on the preprocessed data, such as Random Forest Regressor and Extra Tree Regressor.</li>
                <li><b>Data Evaluation:</b> Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).</li>
                <li><b>Data Deployment:</b> Once a satisfactory model is developed, deploy it as part of the application where it can predict car prices based on new input data.</li>
